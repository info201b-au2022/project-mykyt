## Abstract
 As economic circumstances and demographic forces have fluctuated, so have the size and composition of the homeless population. In the United States, homelessness is a significant problem with no solution that worsens yearly. This problem is crucial because it has a ripple effect throughout the community. It impacts everybody, from crime and safety levels to the workforce and the use of tax dollars.

**Keywords**: _homelessness_, _poverty_, _homelessness across U.S._.

## Introduction
The issue of homelessness in America has been around since the 1930s, leaving millions of people without homes and jobs during The Great Depression. Nowadays, across the country, men, women and children spend their nights on the streets, not knowing when or if they will ever find a permanent home. States, federal officials and city councils have tried to alleviate or at least reduce the number of homeless over the last several decades. However, it continues to be an ongoing problem exacerbated by the recent pandemic and the housing crisis.

Homelessness is a complex social problem that affects individuals, communities, and societies in more ways than one, whether we experience it or not. People going through homelessness live on the shadowy edges of society. This condition puts people at higher risks for victimization, poor health, loneliness, and depression, leading to chemical dependency, crime, and other issues which directly impact our communities. This safety uncertainty also directly affects the economy, costing the government millions of taxpayer dollars to deal with the issue that does not seem to be the solution.

The homelessness problem will be addressed by bringing attention to the issues that it causes. The goal is to raise awareness and educate the public about it, which could potentially help with future actions to reduce the number and the impact of homelessness across the U.S.

## Research Questions

+ What states are most and least affected by homelessness? What is the total amount of homeless people across the U.S.?

+ What age, race, and sex tends to become homeless the most ?

+ How the problem got worse overtime, or did it get better in the timespan of 14 years?

## Expected implications

While there is considerable controversy about the number of homeless people, there is general agreement that the number is becoming greater as each year passes. As the number increases, so do the complexities of the homelessness problems. And in order to the problem to stop expanding, certain actions has to be made.

The project will deliver the analysis of how the crisis got worse in the timespan of 14 years, what age, sex, and races get affected by it the most. The goal is to raise attention to the problem and make readers to ask why does it happen and make them think how it can be reduced and prevented in the future.
